1\. Citizens must attend secure voting booths and present proof of citizenship to access premises. Early in-person voting should be available for up to 30 days in advance.

2\. A unique ballot with a unique ID/barcode is printed by a machine upon the citizens arrival. This updates a database country wide preventing the printing of another ballot for this citizen.

3\. Citizen fills out vote. Citizen signs ballot. Citizen submits ballot in ballot box.

4\. Ballot boxes are securely locked and transported in secure vans with armed guards to secure location.

5\. Ballots are tabulated by machine first, then tabulated by a human.

6\. Federal elections are organised, funded and setup by the federal government. No state has the right to interfere or modify any part of the process.

7\. Citizens from the local community are invited to witness tabulation and ensure validity.
