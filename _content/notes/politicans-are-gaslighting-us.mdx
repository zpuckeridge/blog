Politicians say the number of houmes being built is the problem. Not the mass unchecked immigration.

That importing more workers to build them faster is the solution.

They don't seem to realise that the more people you bring in, the more houses you need to build - exacerbating the problem even further. Not to mention the additional strain on other resources (i.e. hospitals, schools etc.)

The solution is simple.

Stop the mass unchecked immigration.
