BoJack Horseman is the kind of character you can laugh with, cry, hate and love all at the same time. The show BoJack Horseman delves into a multitude of complex human issues, exploring themes such as family dynamics, love, fleeting happiness, addiction, nihilism, abuse, mortality, mental health, and the pursuit of legacy.

The creators of the show demonstrate a deep affection for their characters. Writer Raphael Bob-Waksberg crafts unique character arcs that both inspire and challenge audiences. The depth and relatability of the side characters' lives ground the show in reality, even in moments like the interaction between BoJack and Eddie the dragonfly in S4 E2, where their desire for connection is palpable but are unable to make that final connection.

The overarching theme of the show revolves around the struggle for happiness amidst life's cruelties and unmet expectations. BoJack copes by immersing himself in vices, seeking distractions from his inner turmoil, often leading to destructive behavior that affects his relationships. We saw that with Wanda, and frankly, most of his relationships.

We see a similar trend with all of the characters in the show of success and failure and never being quite satisfied with either. It wasn't until they began to take responsibility for their actions that they truly started to come to terms with their meaningless lives.

BoJack Horseman offers a diverse range of narratives, with BoJack's relatability resonating with many viewers. The show prompts introspection, making audiences reflect on their own choices and experiences. While personally captivating, the emotional journey it leads viewers on is intense, akin to a mirror reflecting one's thoughts and desires with unfiltered honesty.

An emotional roller-coaster.

Diane's closing words perfectly encapsulates the ebbs and flows of relationships and their profound impact on our lives. It's a reminder that even amidst the chaos, there is always a glimmer of hope, a chance for growth and redemption.

> There are people that help you become the person you end up being, and you can be grateful for them, even if they were never meant to be in your life forever.

Even though these are just animated anthropomorphic animal characters in a loosely realistic world, it doesn't change what the creators of this show wanted to convey. The scenarios portrayed in BoJack Horseman are exceptionally down to earth, so much so that we simply can't help but see ourselves in them at every turn.
