description: Reflecting on work-life balance and arguing against common complaints.

On X recently, I saw a post complaining about the modern work-life balance.

Reflecting on it for a moment, I started thinking about all of the free time I would have if I didn't keep myself busy with the projects I'm working on.

After some thought, I came to this conclusion:

There are 168 hours total in a week, 56 hours for sleep (8 per night), 55 hours for work (7am - 6pm, allowing time for commute)

168-111 = 57 hours to browse TikTok (kidding of course).

Wake up at 7. Commute to work. Work from 9-5. Get home at 5:30, cook dinner/eat. Then, from 6pm build/do something for 5 hours. That's 25 hours of work possible during the week with the remainder split across the weekends.

Seems pretty balanced to me! Sure, it could be better - less travel time, better economic buying power for time spent etc.

But really, we live in some of the best working conditions in all of human history. We really only have minor complaints.

Let's use all the hours that God has granted us to their maximum potential!
