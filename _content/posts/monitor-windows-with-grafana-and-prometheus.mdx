This article covers the installation and configuration process of OhmGraphite to work with Prometheus and send statistics to Grafana.

### Prerequisites

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Windows 10/11 with Administrator Privileges

NOTE: Administrator Privileges is required for installation.

### Getting Started

Before we begin the installation of OhmGraphite, let's first create a directory for our files to live in.

For this example, we will be storing OhmGraphite in the following directory:

```
C:\OhmGraphite\
```

### Downloading and Installing OhmGraphite

We will be using OhmGraphite as our statistic exporter. Head on over to: [https://github.com/nickbabcock/OhmGraphite/releases/latest](https://github.com/nickbabcock/OhmGraphite/releases/latest) to grab the latest version.

Once you have downloaded the Zip folder, extract it and place the contents in the folder we created earlier.

Now let's edit the OhmGraphite.exe.config file to set it up to work with Prometheus.

Replace the contents of the file with the following code:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="type" value="prometheus" />
    <add key="prometheus_port" value="4445" />

    <!-- This is the host that OhmGraphite listens on.
         `*` means that it will listen on all interfaces.
         Consider restricting to a given IP address -->
    <add key="prometheus_host" value="*" />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

Save and close the file.

NOTE: You can edit this file at any time, but you will need to restart the application for the changes to make effect.

Open a Powershell window in Administrator mode and enter the following command:

```
C:\OhmGraphite\OhmGraphite.exe run
```

Next, run the following command to install OhmGraphite as service that starts on boot:

```
C:\OhmGraphite\OhmGraphite.exe install
```

After installation, run the following command to start OhmGraphite:

```
C:\OhmGraphite\OhmGraphite.exe start
```

OhmGraphite has been successfully setup and is ready to go! Now let's configure Prometheus.

### Setup Prometheus to look for OhmGraphite

In your Prometheus configuration file, add an additional job to the stack:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'ohmgraphite'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['10.0.0.200:4445']
```

Once this has been added, restart Prometheus. OhmGraphite will now be picked up by Prometheus and be ready to serve to Grafana.

### Grafana Dashboard

In your Grafana installation, import a new dashboard with the following code 11587.

This dashboard is pre-configured to look for OhmGraphite export by Prometheus.

The graphs should auto-populate with statistics as they roll in.
