Cramming information is useful if you want to look smart, but thinking and approaching problems the right way is an attribute few possess.

Institutions would do well to teach their students how to think and approach problems with critical thought over throwing buckets of information at them. Being able to critical assess a problem, see an argument from both sides, rationalise their worldview and accept when their wrong will prepare a student for lifelong success.

Not only will this create well rounded non-emotionally driven individuals (just par the course), it will also create opportunities and incredible student outcomes. Only critical thinkers or "smart" people lead businesses, go into politics and make the world a better place, well, that's how it should be unless you're a DEI hire or bark the right tune...
