Freedom isn't freedom if you're enslaved to your flesh.

If your entire life is realised by decisions that gratify your base desires, are you really operating of your own thoughts and free will? No, you aren't. You are controlled by the desires of your flesh - that isn't freedom. That's slavery—slavery to sin.

God has offered us the only way to be free from this slavery through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ for the sins of the world. Although we do not deserve it, He has seen it fit to send His one and only son to bear the punishment for our crimes.

Not only did we trample and poison His creation, but we also killed God's own son. The fact He does not just destroy us all will always remain a mystery to me.

God has offered us a second chance - all you must do now is repent and believe in the saving work of Christ on the cross and you will be saved.

Do you want to be free?
