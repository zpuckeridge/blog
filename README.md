# Personal Blog

This is my personal corner of the internet, a place to experiment, learn and try new things. The goal of this project is to have a forward-facing display site to show employers a quick overview of my skills and capabilities in a minimalistic and simple fashion.

This project is forked from the gatsby-starter-blog. I have been tweaking and adding features to make it my own.
