        "This book opened my eyes to how far we, as men, have failed by falling into the lie of egalitarianism and feminism. It expoesd parts of my heart that had yet to be dealt with or even considered and laid out a Biblical framework for a return to a right and sanctified masculinity.",

        "This book preceeds It's Good To Be A Man and is more directed at parents raising young men. However, I found great value in this book - not only from a future parenting perspective but also from a personal perspective. It exposed areas that my parents failed and laid out the consequences of those failures, which lined up perfectly with my experience. This book has helped me understand why I am the way I am and how to begin changing that.",

        "This book couldn't have come at a more perfect time. At the time of reading, I was weighing up my options between moving to rural Queensland or staying in Brisbane. There were a few reasons I was considering the change, the main factor being employment and the cost of living. This book helped me to make the decision to remain in Brisbane and to continue building God's kingdom where I was.",
