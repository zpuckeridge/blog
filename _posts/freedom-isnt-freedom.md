Freedom isn't freedom if your're enslaved to your flesh.

If you're entire life is realised by decisions that gratify your base desires, are you really operating of your own thoughts and free will? No, you aren't. You're controlled by the desires of your flesh - that isn't freedom. That's slaveryâ€”slavery to sin.

God has offered us the only way to be free from this slavery through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ for the sins of the world. Although we don't deserve it, He has seen it fit to send His one and only son to bear the punishments of our crimes.

Not only did we trample and poison His creation, we killed God's own son. The fact He doesn't just destroy us all is a msytery to me.

God has offerred us a second chance - all you must do now is repent and believe in the saving work of Christ on the cross and you will be saved.

Do you want to be free?
