I can guarantee that at least more than half of that number are not even real mental health issues. Mostly just names for the signs of unfaithful households, absent fathers, trauma and a desire to gratify the flesh.

Needless to say, these people need our prayer. They need to hear the good news of Jesus Christ and what He has done for us in His death.
