It was Wednesday the 14th of July and I was bored out of my mind, so much so I remember wishing for the weekend. My two remaining brain cells had evaporated and I knew it was time to find something to give my brain a break.

I mean sure, there were half a dozen things I probably could have been doing instead, learning web dev, cleaning my office etc.
But for some reason, rather unsurprisingly, I found myself browsing YouTube once again.

_scroll_ _scroll_ _scroll_ sigh... nothing interesting to watch.

I was about to give up when I scrolled one more time and saw Sideways
video on 'Why A Goofy Movie is Better Than You Remember'.

["https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6j-562xQSs"]

Intrigued, I started watching only to find I was basically watching some dude fan boy over a 25 year old movie from the 90s. _Well now, he better hook me real quick or I'm outta here... didn't grow up in the 90s, can't relate, sorry._

What can I say except that he portrayed this movie in such a way that I essentially _had_ to watch it!

Growing up, I wasn't exposed to too many Disney films outside of the big classics (The Lion King/Tarzan) and never saw Goof Troop (the TV show predecessor to this movie) but I instantly fell in love with Goofy and the general premise of the movie.

As of writing, this film might be my favourite film of all time!

The moment I finished watching, I was looking up Wikipedia articles on
characters, learning the songs, and trying to find out why I had never heard of this movie until now!

This movie establishes itself so gawrsh darn well in the first five
minutes, connecting its audience with the characters exceptionally well, exposing us to their flaws, desires, goals and hopes while also leaving plenty of room to expand on these characteristics.

Yet it doesn't just stop there, it continues to develop on the themes
it introduced and offer thought provoking and challenging questions on
how to raise your kids, a relationship between ones father and son, maturity, trust and other themes.

From the opening number, to meeting Roxanne, to seeing Goofy and the
strong desire Max has to be _anything_ but his father. It sets the stage so
perfectly for what is an amazing father-son adventure full of life
lessons for both the characters that translate exceptionally well to the audience.

I'm fortunate to have a great relationship with my father, but I still felt like I
needed to catch up and give him a massive hug after watching this
movie.

The entire movie hinges on the desires of Max and Goofy. Max wanting
to abandon everything that makes him look like his father, to try and find his independence and
Goofy simply trying to be more involved in his sons life, maybe a little too
much for Max's own good.

It's a serious topic that doesn't get nearly enough screen time in
media. The overbearing parent and rebellious child trope rarely ever
find a middle ground.

Typically, the overbearing parent is often used as a story trope to
get the main character to do something they normally wouldn't do, then
completely forgotten at the end of the movie once the villain or
problem has been defeated. You can see a similar thing in the Pixar
movie Luca with his overprotective mother. She basically flips her
entire attitude at the end of the movie with not much of a second
thought or any sort of conflict resolution.

Unlike Luca though, A Goofy Movie actually addresses these issues and
our main characters come to a mutual understanding. Goofy
learns to back off a bit, and Max learns to let his father into his
life more, both appreciating each other for their differences, yet also embracing them, allowing for both charcters to mutually benefit from this much healthier father-son relationship.

The dynamic between these characters in the more serious scenes is
serviced so well that it adds an incredibly difficult to replicate
layer of depth to the topics outlined. Jason Marsden and Bill Farmer
execute these scenes perfectly and stay true to their characters
through and through.

But why am I inspired you might ask?

Simply put - I desire to tell stories like this film. I've never really
thought about creating media, writing stories, drawing or animation as
a career, but after watching this movie and seeing how it touched me,
I want to replicate this over and over again, not just for myself, but
for other people too.

I desire to be apart of a team like the one that worked on A Goofy
Movie. I want to animate, be creative and come up with ideas and
stories that touch future generations like this movie had touched me -
nearly 25+ years after it was made.

Primarily, I've been inspired to learn how to animate and make
loveable and attractive characters that captivate audiences, so that they too may share
the same depth and love that I have for A Goofy Movie.

It sounds completely outrageous for a 21 year old in tech to be suddenly interested in creative arts, but come to think of it, I can't say that I've been this interested in telling stories like A Goofy Movie.

Will I completely drop tech? Definitely not! I need money to survive, don't
be silly. Not to mention, I _love_ programming, networking and all of the goodness that entails, plus I still have plenty of things I want to learn in tech too - choppin' that up with more creative learning will certainly be a good thing for retaining information.

Anyway, that's my rant about why A Goofy Movie is my favourite
movie right now!

Peace. ‚úåÔ∏è

PS - don't forget check out the music for this movie too. Absolute gold mine that
I've had on repeat for weeks...
