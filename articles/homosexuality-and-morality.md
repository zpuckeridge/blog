Before I continue with this article, I'd like to take some time to
pray for you, the reader, and that the words on this page speak true
to your heart and the hearts of others.

For anyone that has been badly treated by hateful Christians, I deeply
and sincerely apologise. I can only pray that God helps you to find
peace and forgiveness in your heart for these people. If you find
yourself reading this and would like to reach out, please feel free to
do so by emailing me.

Let me be abundantly clear. All sin is covered by the death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ when he sacrificed himself for our sins.
He bore our sins, future, past and present. There is no sin which can
not be forgiven except blaspheming the Holy Spirit. I'll be writing an
article on that soon to explain what that actually means.

Many Christians misconstrue and misunderstand what God and the Bible
has to say about homosexuality. More often than not, this pushes
people even further away from coming to truly understand who Christ is
and what His sacrifice on the cross means for them.

The culture of our planet is changing - especially as technology
continues to develop and spread itself into all corners of the globe.
Sexual promiscuity is frequently promoted and encouraged all over the
world and is considered by many as a perfectly legitimate lifestyle.
I'm not here to judge your life choices, nor do I agree that we should
ostracise and exclude those of different beliefs.

This article seeks to understand what God thinks about these issues,
we must turn to the Bible and science.

_Note: While this article was written with the intention of a
non-Christian and Christian audience, it may be more catered to a
Christian audience debating whether or not homosexuality is sinful._

### What does the Bible say?

God has not made Himself unclear. The first mention of homosexuality
within the Bible is in Genesis 13:13.

> the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinful against the
> LORD.

A few chapters later we find out the “exceedingly wicked” behaviour
they were participating in.

> Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city
> of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. They called to
> Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to
> us so that we can have sex with them.” - Genesis 19:4-5

The book of Jude reveals to us the consequence of their actions,
making it very clear to us that God does not approve of this
behaviour. He finds it utterly reprehensible.

> In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave
> themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an
> example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. - Jude 7

In the Law of the Bible, death was the order for homosexuals.

> “If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,
> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to
> death; their blood will be on their own heads." - Leviticus 20:13

Homosexuality is listed with a whole host of other sins including the
uncovering of nakedness of near of kin, those near in relations, or
during menstruation, adultery, bestiality etc.

> "Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman;
> that is detestable." - Leviticus 18:22

Everything in Leviticus 18 is considered an "abomination" to God and
are clearly practices that He has always hated. He also leaves a very
clear warning:

> "Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how
> the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.
> Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the
> land vomited out its inhabitants. But you must keep my decrees and
> my laws. The native-born and the foreigners residing among you must
> not do any of these detestable things, for all these things were
> done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land
> became defiled. And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as
> it vomited out the nations that were before you. Everyone who does
> any of these detestable things—such persons must be cut off from
> their people. Keep my requirements and do not follow any of the
> detestable customs that were practiced before you came and do not
> defile yourselves with them. I am the Lord your God." – Leviticus
> 18:24-30

For those that argue that the Old Testament need not apply as Jesus
fulfilled it, it's important to consider that Jesus' purpose was not
to set aside the Law of Moses.

> "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I
> have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell
> you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not
> the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law
> until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside
> one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly
> will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices
> and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of
> heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that
> of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not
> enter the kingdom of heaven." - Matthew 5:17 - 20

Jesus commanded obedience to Moses' Law and it's original intent.
Whereas murder was “liable for judgment” (Matthew 5:21) in the Law,
now “anger is liable for judgment.” (Matthew 5:22) and “hell-fire.”
Whereas adultery was prohibited in the Law, now “lustful intent” is
condemned, since it is indeed the source of adulterous behavior. In
sum, the Messiah did not come to lay aside the Law, but to fulfill its
original purpose.

Not to mention, the New Testament makes it abundantly clear:

> "Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts
> to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one
> another. 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and
> worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is
> forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to
> shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations
> for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural
> relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.
> Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in
> themselves the due penalty for their error." - Romans 1:​24 - 27

> “Do not be misled. Those who are sexually immoral, idolaters,
> adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts, men who practice
> homosexuality, thieves, greedy people, drunkards, revilers, and
> extortioners will not inherit God’s Kingdom.”​ - 1 Corinthians
> 6:​9, 10.

### Jesus never spoke about Homosexuality directly

Actually Jesus did speak about Homosexuality and other sexually
deviant behaviours. Jesus directly confronts "porneia" in Matthew
15:19 which is often translated as either fornication or sexual
immorality which includes all sexually deviant behaviour outside of
the bond of marriage between one man and one woman.

> "But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the
> heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil
> thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false
> testimony, slander." - Matthew 15:18 - 19

### Was the Bible mistranslated?

Leviticus 20:13 refers to boys, not men ie. pedophilia, not
homosexuality.
[German translations in the reformation period also suggest that this may be the case.](https://www.forgeonline.org/blog/2019/3/8/what-about-romans-124-27)

While it is incredibly tempting to believe these interpretations, we
must use history to determine whether this was an acceptable practice
in the church. In church history, there have been no examples of
homosexual marriage or condoned homosexual relationships. These
translations also tend to be sketchy, as many writers of the KJV/other
translations were known for putting in their own interpretations.

To know the truth, we must refer to Jewish history and the dead sea
scrolls - which clearly show that homosexual marriage was not a
condoned practice.

To further prove this point, God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because
they were partaking in:

Jude 1:7

> ... Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up
> to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of
> those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.

Genesis 19:5

> They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight?
> Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”

If you're still unsure about this, what does your conscious say?
Ignore all of your biases and prejudices, and ask yourself. Is this
something God wants to me to participate in? Is this an activity
glorifying to God? If you don't get a definite answer, I would advise
you to stay well away from these temptations. The enemy is known to
take advantage of those who are broken, weak or feel misunderstood.

### Homosexuality is natural, isn't it?

Many people are quick to point out that homosexuals are simply "born
that way". Although it is alleged to have some genetic basis,
scientific research has not been explicitly conclusive. [1, 2]

The inconclusiveness of these studies left leading Columbia University
psychiatrists Byne and Parsons to conclude that:

> "There is no evidence at present to substantiate a biological
> theory, just as there is no compelling evidence to support any
> singular psychosocial explanation. . . .[T]he appeal of current
> biological explanations may derive more from dissatisfaction with
> the present status of psychosocial explanations than from a
> substantiating body of experimental data. Critical review shows the
> evidence favoring a biological theory to be lacking." [3]

From a scientific standpoint, there is no good reason to believe that
there exists a biological link to homosexual behaviour. If a link were
ever established, it would still not morally justify homosexuality for
a few reasons.

A lot more research would need to be completed to work out why this
behaviour exists and how it translates into the lives of everyday
people. One would also need to differentiate if homosexual behaviour
causes the biological condition or if the biological condition is the
cause of the homosexual behaviour.

If the biological condition causes homosexuality or predisposes it in
an individual, it would still not make the behaviour "good" or morally
permissible. Many Christians interpret all that is natural to be good.

_If I am 'naturally' predisposed towards homosexuality, than it must
be good!_

This train of thought does not overlap so well in other areas of life.
For example, what if I am naturally selfish, violent or predisposed
toward addiction, adultery or paedophilia? Researchers believe that
there is a definite genetic basis for alcoholism, yet we do not think
that alcoholism is good. Any reasonable person would believe that
alcoholism should be treated and "cured".

If this is true, should we not attempt to "cure" homosexuals from a
behaviour that appears divergent from the norm much the same way as
alcoholism?

Does our natural inclination or desire for things make them good? The
Bible teaches us that the human heart is corrupt and must be
regenerated by God, through Jesus Christ.

> “If any man be in Christ he is a **new creation**. The old is
> passed, behold the new is come.” - 2 Corinthians 5.17

_Might there be other examples that prove homosexuality is a natural
behaviour? Well, animals engage in homosexual behaviour, what makes
them so different than us? Even chimpanzees and other apes are known
to engage in the behaviour. So, if it occurs in nature, it must be
natural for humans too!_

Similarly to the first argument, this doesn't overlap very well when
you apply this concept to the actions of other animals.

Animals are not civilised. For example, many animals eat their young
as soon as they are born. That certainly isn't permissible for human
beings... If we are to hold to this premise literally, it would imply
that there is no moral difference between animals and humans.

Just because some animals engage in homosexual behaviour, does not
mean that human homosexuality is natural, or morally good. Studies
also show clear abnormalities with regard to homosexuality amongst
animals. Thomas Schmidt explains that:

> Animals do not engage in long-term homosexual bonding as humans do.
> Some monkeys and apes mount or fondle each other to the point of
> sexual arousal, but even this behavior involves numerous
> qualifications: most important, the behavior does not continue when
> the individual matures and has a heterosexual option. [4]

Even if this was a good argument for homosexuality, one could also
argue that animals and the natural order of things were corrupted when
sin was introduced to the world through Adam.

A point in favour of genetic homosexuality is actually the Bible. It
talks about inter-generational sin and how the sins of the father are
passed down for up to four generations. Which means, if my
great-great-great grandfather engages in homosexual sin, his "genetic
sin" is actually passed down to me by blood according to the Bible,
which is also why all new borns are technically born in sin in the
eyes of the Lord - but that's definitely outside of the scope of this
article! Note that that DOES NOT mean God does not have mercy for
infant deaths, but it's important to recognise that no one is free
from sin without Christ.

[Another argument to bring to the forefront is the very well documented health risks of homosexuality promiscuity.](https://virtueonline.org/negative-health-effects-homosexuality)

### Natural Inclination

Homosexuality may _feel_ natural to some, but our guide to what is
"natural" or "good" is the Bible. God's desires for His creation is
not that it is destroyed by sin, but that it is set free from its
corruptive and destructive nature.

> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that
> they may have life, and have it to the full. - John 10:10

Homosexuality can never result in procreation - therefore it is
impossible for it to bring life. If we are charged to bring life to
the world, than how does homosexuality fit into this outlook? One
might argue that they weren't called to bear children, which is a fair
argument, but this argument really only works if they've dedicated
they're life in service of Christ.

### Can I be 'gay' and Christian?

This question ultimately comes down to whether or not our identity
lies within Christ or our own sexuality. Christians are in union with
Christ and that should be our only identity (Ephesians 2:6).

We are all required to lay down our selfish desires at the cross and
follow Jesus (Mark 8:34). Our sexual attractions should never be the
foundation of our identity. Christ is our rock and our strength. Our
identity is what God says about us in His Word.

All Christians have desires or attractions which do not conform with
our new nature in Christ. These can take form in anything from greed,
to lust, to lying.

If you are a Christian that struggles with same sex attraction, you
need to start by agreeing that this is not something God desires for
your life. We need to stay close to God to avoid temptation or
self-deceive ourselves into believing that homosexuality is acceptable
before God.

Temptation is part of the life of the Christian and can only be
resisted by remaining faithful to God. We must choose not to nurture
temptation or act on urges set on by it's luring grasp.

> "So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires
> of the flesh." - Galatians 5:16

Armed with a good spiritual routine of Bible study, prayer and
worship, we will have the strength to resist temptation.

If our identity is in that of the world and not of Christ, we are
nothing but an imposter and are self-deceiving ourselves. Scripture
does not allow for any possible scenario where homosexual behaviour is
glorifying to God.

### Conclusion

The Bible appears to be very clear on its stance of homosexual
behaviour. I simply can not find an honest interpretation that affirms
homosexual behaviour in any form. We are all born into a sinful world
and no sin is irreversible. We must seek God in all that we do and ask
him to help us with our burdens.

The power of the Gospel is mightier than the power of sin.

I would be remissed not to talk about how very ashamed I am at how the
wider church and how certain religious people choose to avoid and hate
homosexuals. It's okay to believe and practice different things,
people should not hate another for their life choices. Jesus talked
with and helped many of those that were outcast by society, and we
should aim to serve like Him. It's not our job to condemn those that
we deem to sin against the Lord, that is between them and God and
should be left as such. We can only guide and point to what the Bible
says.

Christians that complain about the culture changing and moving away
from what they prefer have no one to blame but themselves for failing
to meet the needs of society. The reason the church was respected was
because it actually helped people. These days, churches hardly operate
outside of their Sunday service. This topic is definitely worth
another article, something akin to "How the Modern Church failed
Society".

If Christians are not reaching people, we have failed the great
commission. Christians (including myself) need to step up and be
examples of God's grace and mercy, for that alone should be what draws
people in - not shouting at them on a crowded train where they have no
choice but to listen.

Ultimately, it isn't my place, or really anyone's place to tell you
what to do except, in my opinion God and the Bible. You may not
believe in God or the Bible, and that is totally fine. In fact, I have
a lot of respect for people that have come to a decision about it. If
someone is interested in talking about faith, then count me in! But
I'm not going to force my beliefs on someone, it's morally
rephrensible.

Another thing to add, this is simply an opinion that I have come to
after heavily researching this topic. Personally, I have really
struggled with homosexuality in my personal life and it is not a light
topic for me to talk about. I am extremely open to debate regarding
the interpretation of scripture.
